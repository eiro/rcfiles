Scratchpad                                                         *scratchpad*

A Scratchpad is a persistent file where you can take notes and experiment
things.

Scratchpads are stored in a $VIM_SCRATCHPAD_ROOT directory
(the default is ~/.vim-scratchpad). Those files aren't removed while you're
leaving vim so you can leave notes and snippets from sessions to sessions.

>
     :Scratchpad [filetype]
<

opens a Scratchpad named after this filetype and setf this filetype.
by default, the filetype of the current buffer is used. so when you are  
editing an SQL script, those 2 commands have the same effect

    :Scratchpad 
    :Scratchpad sql
