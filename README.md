# my rc files

those are some files of my daily setup. lovely home made since the last millenium.

the way i use this repo is

* clone it into `~/local/etc`
* install symlinks in the right files, like 

    ln -s $PWD/zsh/zshenv ~/.zshenv 
    ln -s $PWD/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc 
    ln -s $PWD/haskeline ~/.haskeline
    # and so on ...

from time to time, move some files in separated repos as i want to share them 
using [vim pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
or [zsh uze](https://github.com/eiro/uze).
